# Spatiotemporal Data Analysis Visualization

### Topics
1. **ArcPy package**:

    for vector data: MakeXYEventLayer_management, Select_analysis, SelectLayerByLocation_management, Buffer_analysis, SpatialJoin_analysis, etc.; 

    for raster data: GetRasterProperties_management, CalculateStatistics_management, CompositeBands_management (for compositing a map based on elevation values), etc.

2. **matplotlib** package for the visualization of the population change 
3. **json** package for converting csv to geojson, with pandas package to read csv 
4. **numpy** package as np # for the array creation and calculation
5. **gdal** package for calculating NDVI with landsat images #from osgeo import gdal: using the gdal module to do the raster processing
6. **scikit-learn** package for K-means Clustering and DBSCAN
7. **tweepy** package for collecting tweets from Twitter Streaming API
8. **ogr** package (OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation) for spatial analysis in finding polylines that intersect with a polygon
9. **fiona**, **shapely**, and **geopandas** for geofeature processing, e.g., reading shapefiles, performing spatial relationship verification including within, intersect, etc.
